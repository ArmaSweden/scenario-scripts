 - ENGIMA'S PARKED VEHICLES (VERSION 1.0) -
--------------------------------------------

Engima's Parked Vehicles is a scripts that adds parked vehicles to an Arma 3 mission.

Vehicles of different types are spawned an garages and beside certain buildings across the map/terrain at the beginning of
the mission.

For a vehicle to be spawned in or outside a building there has to be a garage definition entry for that building in the file
Engima\ParkedVehicles\GarageDefinitions.sqf. Garages and some other buildings for islands Stratis, Altis and Tanoa are 
supported out of the box. Anyone can add more garage definitions when needed.

Script works in singleplayer, multiplayer, hosted, dedicated for JIPs.

Until version 1.0 is released, there may be major changes in the script from time to time.


--- LICENCE AND CODE ---

Script is licensed with MIT. Code is at Github on the following URL:
https://github.com/XEngima/Arma3-Scripts-ParkedVehicles


--- VERSION HISTORY ---

1.1:   Added function PARKEDVEHICLES_MonitorGarageDefinition that can be used to create garage definitions.
       Fixed: Script error when BUILDING_TYPES parameter conatins entries that are not represented as a garage definition.
1.0:   Fixed: Debug markers were not removed upon player absence.
0.14:  Added garage definitions for two buildings.
       Made vehicles spawn and despawn depending on player presence.
0.13:  Added callback ON_VEHICLE_CREATED in parameter list.
       Changed name of parameter key UNIT_CLASSES to VEHICLE_CLASSES.
0.12:  Removed debug information visible at wrong occation.
0.11:  Improved performance.
       Fixed: Script error when a player die in MP.
       Rework of file structure.
0.10:  First usable but unfinished version.


--- CUSTOMIZATION ---

The script can be customized for different behaviors. Customize a script by editing the startup parameters. The startup 
parameters list is an array of key value pairs. A key value pair is a small array where the key object is a string 
with the name of the parameter setting and the value object is the actual value.

Here is an example that uses all parameters and first saves them in a variable named "_parameters". The function call 
that spawns the vehicle is beneath. This code are to be put in Engima\ParkedVehicles\ConfigAndStart.sqf.

------------------------------

// Set custom parameters here
private _parameters = [
	["BUILDING_TYPES", ["Land_FuelStation_02_workshop_F", "Land_GarageShelter_01_F", "Land_FuelStation_01_shop_F", "Land_Supermarket_01_F", "Land_House_Big_03_F", "Land_i_Garage_V1_F", "Land_MilOffices_V1_F", "Land_FuelStation_Shed_F", "Land_i_Stone_HouseBig_V2_F", "Land_i_Stone_HouseSmall_V2_F"]],
	["VEHICLE_CLASSES", ["C_Offroad_01_F", "C_Offroad_01_repair_F", "C_Quadbike_01_F", "C_Hatchback_01_F", "C_Hatchback_01_sport_F", "C_SUV_01_F", "C_Van_01_transport_F", "C_Van_01_fuel_F"]],
	["SPAWN_RADIUS", 1000],
	["PROBABILITY_OF_PRESENCE", 1],
	["ON_VEHICLE_CREATED", {}],
	["ON_VEHICLE_REMOVING", {}],
	["DEBUG", false]
];

// Run script
_parameters call PARKEDVEHICLES_PlaceVehiclesOnMap;

------------------------------

Here is a complete list of the parameters and what they do:

* BUILDING_TYPES (Array): The class names of buildings to include. Each building class name in this list must have a 
  representation in the garage definition list - see file Engima\ParkedVehicles\GarageDefinitions.sqf. Note that if
  you run two instances of this script THE SAME BUILDING TYPE MUST NOT BE INCLUDED IN BOTH INSTANCES.

* VEHICLE_CLASSES (Array): Array of vehicle classes that may be spawned. If you want to see more of one vehicle than 
  another, then have it occur a couple of more often in the array. The following example will spawn 75% quadbikes 
  and 25% transports:
  Example: ["C_Quadbike_01_F", "C_Quadbike_01_F", "C_Quadbike_01_F", "C_Van_01_transport_F"]
  
* SPAWN_RADIUS (Scalar): The spawn radius from all players. Vehicles will be spawned at greater distances than this
  value from all players, and if a vehicle is farther away than this value from all players it will be removed.
  Example: 1000

* PROBABILITY_OF_PRESENCE (Scalar): The probability between 0 and 1 for a vehicle to be spawned for each possible 
  building.
  Example: 0.75

* ON_VEHICLE_CREATED (Code): Code that is executed when a vehicle has spawned. Parameter _this is an array:
    0 (Object): The vehicle that was created.
    1 (Boolean): true if this spawn is the first spawn of the current vehicle in the current garage, and false if this is a 
                 respawn of the vehicle after the vehicle has been removed due to player absence.
    2 (Object): The building that is the garage (or the associated building) for this vehicle.
  Remarks: To be exact this callback is called one second after the vehicle has been created, since if it is destroyed upon
           creation, it will be immediately removed, and this callback will never fire.
  Example: { params ["_vehicle", "_firstSpawn", "_building"]; hint ("Vehicle of type " + typeOf _vehicle + " created!"); }

* ON_VEHICLE_REMOVING (Code): Code that is executed right before a vehicle is removed. Parameter _this is an array:
    0 (Object): The vehicle that will be removed.
    1 (Object): The building that is the garage (or the associated building) for this vehicle.
  Example: { params ["_vehicle", "_firstSpawn", "_building"]; hint ("Vehicle of type " + typeOf _vehicle + " removed!"); }

* DEBUG (Boolean): Whether script is running in debug mode or not. In debug mode all vehicles are marked as dots on 
  the map, as well as all vehicle that blew up upon spawn, and all vehicles that could not spawn due to close large
  objects.
  Example: true

--- TIPS AND TRICKS ---

You can call the script several times with different parameter sets. For example, if you want a certain set of civilian
vehicles spawn in one kind of garage all the time, and military vehicles in half of all harbour magazines: create two 
parameter sets, one for civilian vehicles where you set garages as building types and probability of precense to 1. And 
one for military vehicles where you set magazines as building types and probability of precence to 0.5. Then call function 
PARKEDVEHICLES_PlaceVehiclesOnMap two times, one time for each parameter set. Just be sure not to include the same building
type in both parameter sets!
